# DSA Pattern

Yep — a few important “standard interview” patterns were missing (or only implied) in our earlier list. Most notably: Trie, Sweep Line, Coordinate Compression, Segment Tree / Fenwick (BIT), Multi-source / Bidirectional BFS, 0–1 BFS, SCC / Bridges, Binary Lifting / Euler Tour, plus a couple DP/string “specials” that show up in tougher rounds.

Here’s the updated master list: patterns + common question types, topic-by-topic.
